Appointment Scheduler for Sample Collection
Objective: This project is to give a schedule for a diagnostic center agent for his sample collection from patients.

Method: I used unsupervised learning to solve this problem. Under selected column names,I used K-means clustering under filtered Data and finally, I sorted the cluster according to the availability time of the patient.

Note: Here each Agent is considered as a particular cluster.

Technologies used: python,html, javascript, CSS, Flask
